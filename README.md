* Agriculture products such as Wheat, rice paddy Minimum support price per Kg. (MSP) forecast.

* Artifial neural network

* Time series 

* Frauds detection 
*There is not much data preprocessing involved beacuse data is cleaned 
and thers is no missing value or outliers.
Algorithms are SVM (it is very slow), Decision Tree and Light GBM. Highest accuracy on test data is above 99 %, metrics are roc curve, rmse score and auc.*

* Pandas and Numpy 
*Some lessons from book pandas data wrangling by wes mckinney*

* Quora duplicate question
*It is binary calssfication problem with accuracy above 80%*

* Common literature target
*It is regression problem and highest rmse score of 0.749. It is about predicting target score ( -1<=score<=1 ) of small paragraph (which is a small story or meaningful content)*
